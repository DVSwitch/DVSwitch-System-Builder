#
# On a Linux based system, such as a Raspberry Pi, this script will perform all  
# the steps required to maintain the YSFHosts.txt (or similar) file for you.
#
# It is designed to run from crontab and will download the YSFHosts from the 
# master ysfreflector.de database and optionally keep a backup of previously
# created files for you.
#
# It will also prune the number of backup files according to a value specified
# by you in the configuration below.
#
# To install in root's crontab use the command ...
#
#     sudo crontab -e
#
# ... and add the following line to the bottom of the file ...
#
#     0  0  *  *  *  /path/to/script/YSFHostsupdate.sh 1>/dev/null 2>&1
#
# ... where /path/to/script/ should be replaced by the path to this script.
