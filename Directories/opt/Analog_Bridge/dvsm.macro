; dvsm.macro
; This is a macro include file for Analog_Bridge(AB)
; The purpose of this file is to provide macro commands for use by DVSwitch Mobile(DVSM)
; These macros execute scripts when a DVSM user requests a mode change.


[MACROS]
; Example: When a DVSM user selects the DMR mode, AB will look for the mode below and execute the script and pass the parameter.
; In this case, AB will execute "/opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh" and pass the prarmeter of "dmr" to the script. 

DMR =   /opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh mode DMR
DSTAR = /opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh mode DSTAR
NXDN =  /opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh mode NXDN
P25 =   /opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh mode P25
YSF =   /opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh mode YSF

; Example TG / Reflector Macro
9876 =  /opt/Analog_Bridge/parrot.sh

6789 = /opt/Analog_Bridge/dvswitch.sh tune REF001CL
